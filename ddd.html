  <h1>About</h1>
  <h5>Founded in 1985, Mookambigai College of Engineering is a proud initiative of the Sri Mariamman Educational, Health, and Charitable Trust, based in Woraiyur, Tiruchirappalli. The management is guided by a team of progressive-minded and benevolent Trustees, with the far-sighted and enthusiastic Late Thiru S. Subramaniam serving as the Founder Chairman. The Trust also operates Srinivasa Polytechnic on the same campus.

Since its inception, Mookambigai College of Engineering has steadily grown, achieving remarkable milestones along the way. Today, it stands as a beacon of excellence, known for its commitment to high educational standards. The institution follows a bi-dimensional approach: fostering strong student-faculty involvement and encouraging continuous interaction between industry, academia, and society.

The primary mission behind establishing the Engineering College was to provide quality technical education to students, particularly from rural and marginalized backgrounds in and around Pudukkottai and Trichy, at an affordable cost. This commitment to affordability does not compromise the quality of education offered. The institution is affiliated with Anna University, Chennai.

Located on a sprawling 200-acre campus in the peaceful village of Kalamavur, along the Trichy-Pudukkottai highway, the college is just 20 km from Trichy Airport, placing it in the geographical center of Tamil Nadu. The region is home to major industrial hubs like BHEL, Ordnance Factory, Golden Rock Railway Workshop, and prestigious educational institutions including NIT, Trichy, IIM, Trichy, and Anna University, Trichy.

With over 13,500 alumni spread across the globe, our graduates continue to contribute to various industries, serving as living testimony to the strong foundations laid by their Alma Mater. At Mookambigai College of Engineering, we are dedicated to nurturing competent, talented engineers who embody ethical and moral values, ready to contribute to our nationâ€™s progress toward becoming a developed country.
